    <br> Cool place, but missing the Midwestern "Nice"                                      
    <br> Now there is boundless opportunity for change  
    <br> The saturdays, where its either study or tailgate on ice          
    <br> Madison lives up to the name, the fame                
    <br> Here I feel like I can do anything

<p> I do love the nature of Colorado and am starting to miss the mountains more as it starts to snow across the West.
<br> Skiing is one of my first loves and I love to try and do it as much as I can every Winter. Vail mountain is also world renowned and I am blessed to call that mountain home. I am excited for the first few snows here but after that it just means cold.
