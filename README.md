<p3>  <br> Coming from Vail, where everything was the same </br>           
<br> Cool place, but missing the Midwestern "Nice"                                      </br>
<br> Now there is boundless opportunity for change   </br>
<br> The saturdays, where its either study or tailgate on ice          </br>
 <br> Madison lives up to the name, the fame                </br>
 <br> Here I feel like I can do anything  			                                        </br>
 <br> Even put a poem here, no shame			     	                                        </br>
 <br> Hope you don't complain                                                           </br>

<!---  What do u want this site to be about alec. --->
<p> I do love the nature of Colorado and am starting to miss the mountains more as it starts to snow across the West.
<br> Skiing is one of my first loves and I love to try and do it as much as I can every Winter. Vail mountain is also world renowned and I am blessed to call that mountain home. I am excited for the first few snows here but after that it just means cold. </br>
